# Cocking Application

First of all I used Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) software design pattern to orgnize the files .
when we goes deep down to the each of  files we will see   

#  Models folder
contain 2 files each of them is a class contain a list of maps (the data of recipes)
# View folder
contain 2 folders :
# Widget:
 which contain all the repeated component to call it each time we need it such as the butoons , the navigation bar , and the titles .
 # Screens:
 the contentof screen folder is basiclly the Ui of the application  

 # view_model folder:
it's contain the files that  links between the ui and the logical functions ,
such as the horizntal and vertical scrollable lists for showing the recipes.
